# Web Document Builder

Builds Web Documents for one to many websites based on content from the Web Document Manager.

## Configure what website to build

The `codename` is entered in the Web Document Manager for a Website. To build Web Documents it is **required** to set a the following environment variable.

```env
WEB_DOCUMENT_WEBSITE_CODENAME
```

We use Netlify for production build and deploys, although this could be done anywhere.

## What's going on here?

`_/data/webdocs.js` Where we connect to the Sanity client (Web Document Manager) and download Web Documents.

`blocks/*` is where Body Content inserts are transformed from content into HTML for the Web Document.

`templates/web-document.njk` This is the single template that renders every web document. It's not too long since much of the page is determined by `blocks`.
